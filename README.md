## About the Project

The challenge is to build out calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. For this purpose you can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge.

Project assumptions:

- Mathematical operations handling like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division,
- Adjust size of the elements to screen size,
- Select color theme based on user preferences,
- Check for the user's initial theme preference in local storage;

Additional assumptions:

- Implementing keyboard shortcuts for improved application control,
- Conducting mathematical operation validation,
- Implementing hover and click button effects.

This is a solution to the [Calculator App on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29).
